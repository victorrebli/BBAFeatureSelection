# # BBAFeatureSelection

The Bat algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization. It was inspired by the echolocation behaviour of microbats, with varying pulse rates of emission and loudness.

This is the implementation of the paper:

**BBA: A Binary Bat Algorithm for Feature Selection**

R. Y. M. Nakamura, L. A. M. Pereira, K. A. Costa, D. Rodrigues, J. P. Papa

Follogin the notebook **examples.ipynb** to see how use the algorithm.
